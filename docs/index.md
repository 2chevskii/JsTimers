# What is JsTimers, exactly?

JsTimers is, as the name implies, a timer library for your .NET applications.

It was built using `.NET Standard 2.0` as target, so it is pretty much
compatible with any target (excluding something so outdated, that
you won't probably wanna use nowadays, like `.NET FW 4.5` for example)

Package goal is to be the easy way of delaying execution of user-defined actions,
to make it as easy as it is in JavaScript environments.
